# Feature Specification: LearnFlow Platform

**Feature Branch**: `1-learnflow-platform`
**Created**: 2026-03-02
**Status**: Implemented
**Input**: AI-powered Python tutoring platform for students and teachers (Hackathon III)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Student Learning Experience (Priority: P1)

Maya, a student learning Python, logs into LearnFlow and sees her dashboard showing "Module 2: Loops - 60% complete". She asks the AI tutor "How do for loops work in Python?" The Concepts Agent explains with interactive code examples. Maya writes a for loop in the embedded Monaco editor, runs it successfully, and receives a quiz. She scores 4/5 and her mastery updates to 68%.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - students learning Python with AI assistance. Without this flow, the platform has no primary user value.

**Independent Test**: Student can log in, ask a question, receive an explanation, write and run code, and see progress update - all without teacher features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Maya is logged in, **When** she asks "How do for loops work?", **Then** she receives a clear explanation with executable code examples
2. **Given** Maya sees an explanation, **When** she writes code in the editor and runs it, **Then** she sees the output within 5 seconds
3. **Given** Maya completes an exercise, **When** she submits her code, **Then** she receives immediate feedback on correctness
4. **Given** Maya takes a quiz, **When** she submits answers, **Then** she sees her score and mastery level updates

### User Story 2 - Teacher Analytics & Intervention (Priority: P2)

Mr. Rodriguez, a teacher, logs in and sees his class dashboard. He receives an alert that James is struggling with list comprehensions (3 wrong answers in a row). He views James's code attempts, then types "Create easy exercises on list comprehensions". The Exercise Agent generates 3 progressive exercises. Mr. Rodriguez assigns them with one click. James receives a notification and completes the exercises.

**Why this priority**: Teacher features amplify the platform's impact by enabling human intervention when AI detects struggle. This differentiates LearnFlow from pure AI tutors.

**Independent Test**: Teacher can view class dashboard, see struggle alerts, generate exercises, and assign them - without requiring student flow to be complete.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** James struggles with a concept, **When** the system detects 3+ consecutive failures, **Then** Mr. Rodriguez receives a struggle alert within 1 minute
2. **Given** Mr. Rodriguez sees the alert, **When** he requests exercises on the topic, **Then** he receives 3 progressively easier exercises
3. **Given** exercises are generated, **When** Mr. Rodriguez assigns them, **Then** James receives a notification immediately

### User Story 3 - Progress Tracking & Mastery Visualization (Priority: P3)

Both students and teachers can view detailed progress dashboards. Students see their mastery levels across 8 Python modules with color-coded indicators (Red: Beginner 0-40%, Yellow: Learning 41-70%, Green: Proficient 71-90%, Blue: Mastered 91-100%). Teachers see class-wide analytics showing which concepts need reinforcement.

**Why this priority**: Progress tracking provides motivation and insight but is not required for the core tutoring experience. Enhances retention and engagement.

**Independent Test**: Dashboard displays mastery data correctly when user has completed exercises and quizzes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student completes exercises, **When** they view their dashboard, **Then** they see accurate mastery percentages per topic
2. **Given** mastery scores update, **When** a student crosses a threshold (e.g., 70% → 71%), **Then** their status color changes from Yellow to Green
3. **Given** a class has multiple students, **When** a teacher views analytics, **Then** they see aggregate performance per module

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a student submits code that causes an infinite loop? **System times out after 5 seconds with helpful error message**
- How does system handle a student submitting the same wrong answer 5+ times? **Triggers struggle detection and offers hint before solution**
- What happens if the AI agent gives an incorrect explanation? **Students can flag responses for teacher review; teachers can override AI feedback**
- How are network interruptions handled during code execution? **Code executes server-side; results cached and synced when connection restored**

## Assumptions

- Users have basic computer literacy and can type questions in English
- Students have no prior Python experience (curriculum starts from zero)
- Teachers have at least basic understanding of Python concepts to interpret AI-generated exercises
- Platform runs on local Kubernetes (Minikube) for development and testing
- AI agents are powered by large language models with code generation capabilities
- Code execution happens in a sandboxed server-side environment with 5-second timeout
